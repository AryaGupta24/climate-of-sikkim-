    <img src="weather.jpg"  style="width:200px;height:100px;">
    <p><h3>The state has five seasons: winter, summer, spring, autumn, and monsoon season.
        <br>
        climate ranges from sub-tropical in the south to tundra in the north.
        <br>
        Most of the inhabited regions of Sikkim experience a temperate climate, with 
        <br>
        temperatures seldom exceeding 28 °C (82 °F) in summer. 
        <br>

        <br>
        The average annual temperature for most of Sikkim is around 18 °C (64 °F).
        <br>
        Sikkim is one of the few states in India to receive regular snowfall.
        <br>
        The snow line ranges from 6,100 metres (20,000 ft) in the south of the
        <br> 
        state to 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) in the north.[59] The tundra-type region
        <br>
        in the north is snowbound for four months every year, and the temperature 
        <br>
        drops below 0 °C (32 °F) almost every night.[54] In north-western Sikkim,
        <br> 
        the peaks are frozen year-round;[60] because of the high altitude, temperatures 
        <br>
        in the mountains can drop to as low as −40 °C (−40 °F) in winter.
        <br>
        <br>

        <img src="w2.jpg"  style="width:200px;height:100px;">
        <br>
        During the monsoon, heavy rains increase the risk of landslides.
        <br> 
        The record for the longest period of continuous rain in Sikkim is 11 days. 
        <br>
        Fog affects many parts of the state during winter and the monsoons, making transportation perilous.</h3></p>
